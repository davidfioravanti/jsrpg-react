        <div class="sectionBg">
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're reading this changelog, HAPPY NEW YEARS INTERNET STRANGER! 2020 is going to be a great year for JSRPG, and this is the first of many new updates to the game!
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this patch, I've added a couple of neat features for players to enjoy. If you look in the options menu (now also located on the login screen), you'll notice a new option
            called "autoplay toggle". Enabling this feature will put JSRPG into a state in which IT PLAYS ITSELF! The "computer" will take control of the player's actions playing through JSRPG just as YOU would.
            It will move the player through the overworld, engage in combat scenarios, and interact with non-combat room events! This feature is in it's infancy, but as the game develops, the AI will become more
            optimal and "better" at making choices!
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>This release is meant to be a proof-of-concept/tech demo presentation, NOT a major release.</b>
        </p>
        <p align="center">------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h3>New Features:</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>You can now enable AUTOPLAY in the options menu! The "computer" AI can:</u></b>
            <br>
            <ul class="text-left">
                <li><b>Navigate the overworld, just as YOU would!</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of the player pressing the movement keys to get around, the AI will fixate on a
                    particular pair of coordinates (X,Y) that correspond to a random room encounter. It will intelligently turn left, right, and
                    move forward, triggering animations. The AI will first move to the chosen X coordinate. Once it reaches that room tile, it will
                    begin movement towards the chosen Y coordinate. On the way to it's destination, the computer will trigger other encounters if it
                    moves over them along it's path!
                <li><b>Choose actions in combat!</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon entering a combat encounter, the RNG turn decider will determine who goes first (the computer or the
                    enemy AI). Once it is the players turn, it will execute actions in turn order. Currently, because blocking on your turn is NOT
                    optimal and has little gameplay value, the computer has a 1/4 chance of choosing block. The algorithm will become more advanced
                    when new gameplay options become available (e.g using items, spells, etc...)!
                <li><b>Interact with non-combat encounters!</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the encounter, the AI will determine the optimal choice out of all actions. It will then proceed
                    through the encounter attempting to finish it. <u>It will ONLY choose to abandon an encounter if there is no chance of a positive outcome,
                    assuming that there is an option to abandon.</u>.
            </ul>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Added a new combat encounter!</u></b>
            <br><br>
            <ul class="text-left">
                <li><b>BEWARE THE PUMPKING!</b></li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most farmers in nearby towns have been dealing with a deadly famine for seasons without end. However, there are a few whose farms are seemingly unaffected; their land remaining fertile while others had withered long ago. Local legends (if you're one to believe  in legends) speak of a dark pact they made with a spirit of nature, promising healthy crops in exchange for a human sacrifice each hallows eve. Some say it takes on the form of a seasonal gourd, brought to life and seeking souls of wanderers to drain. It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!

        <h3>V1.0-alpha  (12/11/2019):</h3>
        <div class="sectionBg">
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JSRPG v1.0-alpha is available to play-test now! Features are limited, but the game itself is fully functional. <b>index.html</b> serves as the hub page for the game, in which the game itself is played inside of an <i>iframe</i>. This allows the user to navigate the various game screens without leaving this index.html page. Currently, the user creates a character by entering a character name. You then go through character creation and play a short tutorial. <b><u>Note:</u> In it's current state, the game will RESET each time you create a character. You can only "continue" where you left off after exiting the game by clicking the "i" button and entering the console command <i>"g.nav traverse "</i>. This will bring you back to traverse.html, retaining your stats/gold/health.</b> In future versions, there will be a continue functionality AND a skip tutorial button.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In JSRPG's current state, you can navigate the overworld, discover random encounters displayed on the map, and see demonstrations of various gameplay systems. At the moment, combat is limited to the "attack" and "defend" buttons. Enemies can only perform basic attacks and have no additional traits or attributes that contribute to their stats. As I continue to build onto combat systems, enemies will be much more dynamic and take randomized actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>This release is meant to be a proof-of-concept/tech demo presentation, NOT a major release. Hundreds of hours have gone into JSRPG's development and concept design so far, and this is only the start of it's journey! Stay posted for very frequent updates and newly iterated features!</b>

        <p align="center">------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h3>New Features:</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The User console now accepts various commands! Try entering the following, and play around with it to get a feel for what it can do:
            <br>
            <ul class="text-left">
                <li><b>g.nav {name of screen you want to go to}</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will redirect the iframe to a particular game page.
                <li><b>color</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will display a slider you can drag to change the game color.
                <li><b>invert {0-200}</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will invert the screen's colors by the given number (percentage).
                <li><b>contrast {0-200}</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This adjusts screen contrast by the given number (percentage).
                <li><b>sepia {0-100}</b></li>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This applies a sepia filter by the given number (percentage).
            </ul>
